# Project Details

The actual project is a goal tracker where you can manage your life goals, break them into smaller pieces, and track their progress.

I had two motivations for this project. One was that I wanted a place to store my goals and having a custom built application for it sounded nice to me.But the main reason was to practice some DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles and patterns that I had learnt.

This application uses onion architecture to separate logic from business logic, and uses Value Objects along with functional programming error handling, making the application very robust and able to gracefully handle edge cases.

After the splash screen you are directed to the login screen.
Google Sign-In built with Firebase Authentication is used.
If already logged in, you are automatically taken to the home screen where there are 3 tabs for viewing the completed goals, the uncompleted goals, or all goals.

You can create new goals and break the goal down into smaller milestones.

Checking all the milestones for a goal completes the goal, and the goal is then viewable in the completed goals tab.
You can visually see how many milestones have been checked by the blue progress bar in the goal list item.

 You can delete the goal.

 You can also delete individual milestones and edit the details of a goal.
