# Project Details

T﻿rickadex is a tool I built to help with my hobby called tricking.

T﻿o understand the project you need to understand "Tricking" a little bit.

### What is tricking?

T﻿ricking is an extreme sport that uses acrobatic movements and kicks from sports like gymnastics, capoeira, break dancing, taekwondo etc. and combines them together into a combination (combo) of connected movements.

Here is my tricking video from 2013.

### Back to the app

The app allows each user to login and track which movements, called "Tricks", they can do.
You can do this by simply going to the Tricks tab and checking the checkbox for the tricks you are able to do.

Then you can generate random combos of the tricks you can do in the Generator tab
You can reset and try for a new random combo, or save the combo.

Once you have saved the combo, it appears in the Combos tab, where you can again check off the combos you are able to do.
