# Dan Archer Hacking

A CTF walkthrough blog, and cyber security badge/certificate showcase.

## Tech Used

* HTML5 
* CSS3
* Typescript
* Next.JS
* Tailwind
* S﻿anity

## T﻿he Project

I designed the entire website in Figma from scratch.

![Web Design on Figma](/assets/img/uploads/danarcherhacking0.png "Web Design on Figma")

T﻿he website is fully responsive and adaptive.

E﻿ach pane independently scrolls, and the search functionality is super fast due to server side static rendering and revalidation.

![Website Functionality](/assets/img/uploads/danarcherhacking5.gif "Website Functionality")

When the size of the website is too small to show both left and right panels, they can be accessed via side menus.

T﻿he whole website is powered by a Sanity CMS.
